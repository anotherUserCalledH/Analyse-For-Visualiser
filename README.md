# Analyse-For-Visualiser
GUI to analyse music and produce csv files
Integrates music information retrieval algorithms into a simple, easy to understand GUI. The GUI was designed primarily to be used with a pitch detection algorithm I proposed in my dissertation, but for demonstration purposes, it currently uses the algorithms included in the TarsosDSP library.
